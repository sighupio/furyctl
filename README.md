## Furyctl

Furyctl is package manager for Fury distribution. It’s simple to use and reads a single Furyfile to download 
packages you need. Fury distribution offers three types of packages:

- **Bases** : Sets of Kustomize bases to deploy basic components in Kubernetes 
- **Modules**: Terraform modules to deploy kubernetes infrastructure and it’s dependencies
- **Roles**: Ansible roles for deploying, configuring and managing a Kubernetes infrastructure

### Furyfile

Furyfile is a simple YAML formatted file where you list which packages(and versions) you want to have. 
You can omit a type if you don't need any of its packages. An example Furyfile with packages listed 
would be like following:

```
# all sections are optional

# map of prefixes and versions used to force a specific version for all the matching roles/modules/bases
versions:
  # e.g. will force version v1.15.4 if the name matches "aws*"
  aws: v1.15.4
  monitoring: master

roles:
  - name: aws/etcd
  - name: aws/kube-control-plane

modules:
  - name: aws/aws-vpc
  - name: aws/aws-kubernetes

bases:
  - name: monitoring
  - name: logging
  # versions can be overridden if needed by specifying them for each package
    version: master
```

You can get all packages in a group by using group name (like `logging`) or single packages under a group 
(like `monitoring/prometheus-operator`).

### Install 

You can find `furyctl` binaries on the [Releases page](https://github.com/sighupio/furyctl/releases). 

Supported architectures are (64 bit):
- `linux`
- `darwin`

Download right binary for your architecture and add it to your PATH. Assuming it's downloaded in your
`~/Downloads` folder, you can run following commands (replacing `{arch}` with your architecture):

```
chmod +x  ~/Downloads/furyctl-{arch}-amd64 && mv ~/Downloads/furyctl-{arch}-amd64 /usr/local/bin/furyctl
```

### Usage

- Once you installed furyctl binary you can see available commands with `furyctl --help`:

```bash
$ furyctl --help

A command line tool to manage cluster deployment with kubernetes

Usage:
  furyctl [command]

Available Commands:
  help         Help about any command
  install      Download dependencies specified in Furyfile.yml
  printDefault Prints a basic Furyfile used to generate an INFRA project
  version      Prints the client version information

Flags:
  -h, --help     help for furyctl
  -t, --toggle   Help message for toggle

Use "furyctl [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

- To install packages, you can run `furyctl install` (within the same directory where your Furyfile is located): 

```bash
$ furyctl install

- You can get furyctl version with `furyctl version`:

```bash
$ furyctl version

Furyctl version  0.1.0
```

- You can print a Furyfile example with `furyctl printDefault`:

```bash
$ furyctl printDefault

roles:
  - name: aws/kube-node-common
    version: v1.0.0

bases:
  - name: monitoring/prometheus-operated
    version: v1.0.0
