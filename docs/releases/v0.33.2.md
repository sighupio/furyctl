# furyctl release v0.33.2

Welcome to the latest release of `furyctl` maintained by SIGHUP by ReeVo team.

## New features 🌟

- [[#640](https://github.com/sighupio/furyctl/pull/640)] Add digAny function: introduced a new function based on Sprig's dig that recurses through the .spec configuration dict using any keys instead of map keys. The function returns the value of nested keys or a default value if any intermediate key is missing, removing the need for intermediate key validation. Usage: `{{ .spec | digAny "key1" "key2" "keyN" <default> }}`.

## Bug fixes 🐞

- [[#637](https://github.com/sighupio/furyctl/pull/637)] Increase e2e AWS infra timeout: increased test timeouts from 120s to 240s for AWS infrastructure e2e tests to prevent flaky failures.

## Breaking Changes 💔

None.
