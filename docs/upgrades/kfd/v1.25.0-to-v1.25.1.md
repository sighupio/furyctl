# Kubernetes Fury Distribution v1.25.0 to 1.25.1 Upgrade Guide

This guide describes the steps to follow to upgrade the Kubernetes Fury Distribution (KFD) from v1.25.0 to 1.25.1.

If you are running a custom set of modules, or different versions than the ones included with each release of KFD, please refer to each module's release notes.

Notice that the guide will not cover changes related to the cloud provider, ingresses or pod placement changes. Only changes related to KFD and its modules.

> ⛔️ **IMPORTANT**
> we strongly recommend reading the whole guide before starting the upgrade process to identify possible blockers.

## Upgrade procedure

As a high-level overview, the upgrade procedure consists on:

1. Upgrading KFD (all the core modules).

### 1. Upgrade KFD

The suggested approach to upgrade the distribution is to do it one module at a time, to reduce the risk of errors and to make the process more manageable.

#### Networking module upgrade

To upgrade the Networking module to the new version, update the version on the `Furyfile.yml` file to the new version:

```yaml
versions:
  networking: v1.12.2
...
```

Then, download the new modules with `furyctl` with the following command:

```bash
furyctl vendor -H
```

Apply your Kustomize project that uses Networking module packages as bases with:

> ⛔️ **IMPORTANT** you may want to limit the scope of the command to only the networking module, otherwise, the first time you apply with `--server-side` other pods may also be restarted.

```bash
kustomize build <your-project-path/networking-base> | kubectl apply -f - --server-side
```

Wait until all Calico pods are restarted and running. You can check Calico's Grafana dashboard "General / Felix Dashboard (Calico)" and the "Networking / *" dashboards to make sure everything is working as expected.

🎉 **CONGRATULATIONS** you have now successfully updated all the core modules to KFD 1.25.1
