# Kubernetes Fury Distribution v1.25.2 to 1.25.3 Upgrade Guide

This guide describes the steps to follow to upgrade the Kubernetes Fury Distribution (KFD) from v1.25.2 to 1.25.3.

If you are running a custom set of modules, or different versions than the ones included with each release of KFD, please refer to each module's release notes.

Notice that the guide will not cover changes related to the cloud provider, ingresses or pod placement changes. Only changes related to KFD and its modules.

> ‚õîÔ∏è **IMPORTANT**
> we strongly recommend reading the whole guide before starting the upgrade process to identify possible blockers.

## Upgrade procedure

### 1. Using furyctl

This release brings in a new version of terraform (and some of its providers), moving past the historical 0.15.4 and settling on 1.4.6.
Such upgrade makes for a trickier than usual upgrade process, so we are providing a helper shell script below that you can use to perform all the required actions automatically, provided you are on standard v1.25.2 cluster.
Copy the following code to a location that is convenient to you, fill in the variables and execute it.

```sh
#!/bin/sh -x

set -e
set -o nounset

# Define the needed variables
CLUSTERNAME="" # Name of the cluster, found both in ~/.furyctl and in your furyctl.yaml
FURYCONFIG="" #¬†Path to the furyconfig.yaml file
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="" # AWS Access Key ID
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="" # AWS Secret Access Key
# export AWS_PROFILE="" # AWS Profile, this can be used instead of the two above
export KUBECONFIG="" #¬†Path to the kubeconfig file

FURYCTL_CPUARCH="amd64"
if [ "$(uname -m)" = "arm64" ]; then
  FURYCTL_CPUARCH="arm64"
fi
FURYCTL_OS="$(uname)"

NOW="$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)"

curl -sSL "https://github.com/sighupio/furyctl/releases/download/v0.25.0-beta.0/furyctl-${FURYCTL_OS}-${FURYCTL_CPUARCH}.tar.gz" | tar xfz - -C /tmp/

echo ">>>> Make a backup of the cluster folder"
if [ -d "${HOME}/.furyctl/${CLUSTERNAME}.${NOW}" ]; then
  rm -rf "${HOME}/.furyctl/${CLUSTERNAME}.${NOW}"
fi
cp -R "${HOME}/.furyctl/${CLUSTERNAME}" "${HOME}/.furyctl/${CLUSTERNAME}.${NOW}"

echo ">>>> Update the furyconfig.yaml file setting the new fury version"
sed 's/distributionVersion\:\ v1\.25\.2/distributionVersion\:\ v1\.25\.3/g' "${FURYCONFIG}" > "${FURYCONFIG}.tmp"
mv "${FURYCONFIG}.tmp" "${FURYCONFIG}"

echo ">>>> Delete terraform folders"
find "${HOME}/.furyctl/${CLUSTERNAME}" -name .terraform -type d | xargs -I {} rm -rf {}
find "${HOME}/.furyctl/${CLUSTERNAME}" -name .terraform.lock.hcl -type f | xargs -I {} rm -f {}

echo ">>>> Remove a problematic job"
kubectl delete job --ignore-not-found=true --namespace=logging minio-logging-buckets-setup

echo ">>>> Run a full 'furyctl create cluster' to ensure all the new templates are applied"
/tmp/furyctl create cluster --debug --log stdout --config "${FURYCONFIG}"
```

### 2. Using KFD directly

The suggested approach to upgrade the distribution is to do it one module at a time, to reduce the risk of errors and to make the process more manageable.

#### Networking module upgrade

To upgrade the Networking module to the new version, update the version on the `Furyfile.yml` file to the new version:

```yaml
versions:
  networking: v1.13.0
...
```

Then, download the new modules with `furyctl` with the following command:

```bash
furyctl legacy vendor -H
```

Apply your Kustomize project that uses Networking module packages as bases with:

> ‚õîÔ∏è **IMPORTANT** you may want to limit the scope of the command to only the networking module, otherwise, the first time you apply with `--server-side` other pods may also be restarted.
>
> The same applies to the rest of the modules, we will not include this warning in every step for simplicity.

```bash
kustomize build <your-project-path/networking> | kubectl apply -f - --server-side
```

Wait until all Calico pods are restarted and running. You can check Calico's Grafana dashboard "General / Felix Dashboard (Calico)" and the "Networking / *" dashboards to make sure everything is working as expected.

#### Ingress module upgrade

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING** some downtime of the NGINX Ingress Controller is expected during the upgrade process.

To upgrade the Ingress module to the new version, update the version on the `Furyfile.yml` file to the new version:

```yaml
versions:
...
  ingress: v2.0.0
...
```

Then, download the new modules with `furyctl` with the following command:

```bash
furyctl legacy vendor -H
```

Apply your Kustomize project that uses Ingress module packages as bases with:

```bash
kustomize build <your-project-path/ingress> | kubectl apply -f - --server-side
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **INFO** you may need to apply twice or thrice because a new Validating webhook is added with this release and it needs some time to come up.

#### Disaster Recovery module upgrade

To upgrade the Disaster Recovery module to the new version, update the version on the `Furyfile.yml` file to the new version:

```yaml
versions:
...
  dr: v2.0.0
...
```

Then, download the new modules with `furyctl` with the following command:

```bash
furyctl legacy vendor -H
```

Apply your Kustomize project that uses Disaster Recovery module packages as bases with:

```bash
kustomize build <your-project-path/dr> | kubectl apply -f - --server-side
```

Check that all velero's pods are up and running, you may want to manually trigger a backup to test that everything is working as expected. For example:

```shell
# create a backup
velero backup create --from-schedule manifests test-upgrade -n kube-system
# ... wait a moment
# check that Phase is completed
velero get backup -n kube-system test-upgrade
# you may want to see some details
velero backup describe test-upgrade -n kube-system
```

> üí° **TIP** you can use a port-forward minio'UI and login to check that the backups are there.

üéâ **CONGRATULATIONS** you have now successfully updated all the core modules to KFD 1.25.3
