# Kubernetes Fury Distribution v1.25.3 to 1.25.4 Upgrade Guide

This guide describes the steps to follow to upgrade the Kubernetes Fury Distribution (KFD) from v1.25.3 to 1.25.4.

If you are running a custom set of modules, or different versions than the ones included with each release of KFD, please refer to each module's release notes.

Notice that the guide will not cover changes related to the cloud provider, ingresses or pod placement changes. Only changes related to KFD and its modules.

> ⛔️ **IMPORTANT**
> we strongly recommend reading the whole guide before starting the upgrade process to identify possible blockers.

## Upgrade procedure

### 1. Using furyctl

Change `.spec.distributionVersion` on your `furyctl.yaml` file with the new `v1.25.4`.

Validate the schema using the new `v0.25.0` `furyctl` version:

```bash
furyctl validate config
```

Add the new fields that are now required, for example `.spec.distribution.modules.dr.type`.

Apply the new configuration on the cluster with:

```bash
furyctl create cluster
```

### 2. Using KFD directly

There are no changes on the modules since the version v1.25.3.
